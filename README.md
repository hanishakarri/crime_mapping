Title: Spatial Analysis for Law Enforcement: Insights into Domestic Violence and Child Abuse Incidents

Description: This GitHub repository hosts a presentation focused on spatial analysis of domestic violence 
and child abuse incidents within the Northern Precinct. The presentation comprises three essential maps, 
each providing valuable insights for law enforcement. Map 1 delves into the incidence distribution of domestic violence, 
pinpointing concentration areas, particularly in the Nora sector. Map 2 presents a geospatial examination of November incidents, 
utilizing choropleth mapping and mean center calculations to highlight temporal patterns. The final map employs advanced spatial analysis techniques, 
including Kernel Density Hotspot Map and Contour with barriers, incorporating the Getis-Ord statistic for hotspot analysis. The presentation underscores the 
strategic resource allocation and enhanced predictive capabilities these maps offer to law enforcement, enabling targeted interventions and fostering a 
proactive approach to public safety. Explore the repository to delve into the details of these maps and their significance in optimizing law enforcement strategies.
